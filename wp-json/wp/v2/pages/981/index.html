I observe treasures of gold and gems as so many bricks and pebbles. I look upon the finest silken robes as tattered rags. I see myriad worlds of the universe as small seeds of fruit, and the greatest lake in India as a drop of oil on my foot. <br><br>I perceive the teachings of the world to be the illusion of magicians. I discern the highest conception of emancipation as a golden brocade in a dream, and view the holy path of the illuminated ones as flowers appearing in one's eyes. I see meditation as a pillar of a mountain, Nirvana as a nightmare of daytime. I look upon the judgment of right and wrong as the serpentine dance of a dragon, and the rise and fall of beliefs as but traces left by the four seasons.\"<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-verse DallE00008\">It was the sixteenth day of the seventh lunar month, the day when the ninety-<br>day summer training period ended and the monks left the temple to travel<br>about as they chose.<br><br>A monk asked \"Today is the sixteenth;' what about it?\"<br>The master said, \"East is east, west is west.\"<br>The monk said, \"What is 'east is east, west is west'?\"<br>The master said, \"Seek but you will not find.\"<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-verse DallE00009\">It was the sixteenth day of the seventh lunar month, the day when the ninety-<br>day summer training period ended and the monks left the temple to travel<br>about as they chose.<br><br>A monk asked \"Today is the sixteenth;' what about it?\"<br>The master said, \"East is east, west is west.\"<br>The monk said, \"What is 'east is east, west is west'?\"<br>The master said, \"Seek but you will not find.\"<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-verse DallE00010\">It was the sixteenth day of the seventh lunar month, the day when the ninety-<br>day summer training period ended and the monks left the temple to travel<br>about as they chose.<br><br>A monk asked \"Today is the sixteenth;' what about it?\"<br>The master said, \"East is east, west is west.\"<br>The monk said, \"What is 'east is east, west is west'?\"<br>The master said, \"Seek but you will not find.\"<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-verse DallE00011\">A monk asked, \"Does a dog have a Buddha-nature or not?\"<br>The master said, \"Not [Mu]!\"<br><br>The monk said, \"Above to all the Buddhas, below to the crawling bugs, all have Buddha-nature.
